# blueprint-vibe

This project intentionally mirrors the simple demo hosted at [barsdeveloper.github.io/ueblueprint](https://barsdeveloper.github.io/ueblueprint/).
It imports the `ueblueprint` web component, loads the same sample graph text into `<ueb-blueprint>`, and keeps the layout identical: a full-height blueprint preview on a plain background.

There is no additional UI or generation logic—this repo serves purely as a minimal reference of how to embed the upstream component.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
