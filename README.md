A UE5 editor plugin that lets you "vibe code" blueprint snippets by describing the desired feature in natural language. It currently sends prompts to the Gemini API and injects the structured answer back into your Blueprint graph as an annotated comment block so you can wire things up quickly. Future updates will add other LLM APIs behind the same interface. The repo and plugin folder are both named **blueprint-gpt**, so you can drop it straight into a project.

Logic creation using blueprints made easy.
